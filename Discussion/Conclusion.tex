Cross domain MEV research is still in its infancy. It is complex to even find data in order to study it. In this thesis we tried to find it in the wild, sampling data from four different domains. We were successful in finding examples of cross-domain arbitrages, but quantifying it proved a difficult problem. It is clear that cross domain MEV and its extraction will only become a greater threat to Ethereums decentralisation in the future.

% We also saw that in order to classify cross domain MEV we methods of doing it with
